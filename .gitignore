# SynT (TheoryBuildingSE) - Git ignore rules
#
# Goal: keep source + docs in Git; ignore build outputs, installers, and IDE
# metadata (NetBeans, IntelliJ, VS Code, Eclipse).

# --- Generated sources / caches

# --- Empty placeholder folders
# Ignore empty test folder used as placeholder
/test/

# --- XML/IDE project metadata you don't want to version
# (NetBeans project.xml/private files are already handled; keep build.xml if needed)

# You can add more patterns below as your workflow evolves.
